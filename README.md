# intersections (Intersections)

This is a secondary chart type for the @autocharts twitter bot. It picks three random words, does a google search for combination of each one, plus all three, gets the frequency of all words in each result set that are not related to the initial words, then puts the top result into the intersection on a venn diagram.
